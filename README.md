<b> Summary - Analysis and Conclusion </b>  





The analysis reveals several critical insights into global suicide trends over time, highlighting differences by sex and age group and exploring potential predictors such as population size and GDP per capita.

Globally, the mean number of suicides per **100,000 population** has been on a declining trend since peaking at **15.3 in 1995**, with projections suggesting rates could fall below previous lows observed in the late 20th century.  

**Gender disparities in suicide rates were evident, with statistical tests confirming a significant difference in median suicide rates between females and males**. For instance, a Wilcoxon test validated these differences, reflecting broader societal and demographic patterns.

Age-based analysis revealed further distinctions, as suicide rates generally increased with age for both sexes, though the overall trend across most age groups has been decreasing. Statistical comparisons confirmed significant differences in median suicide rates across all age groups, within and between sexes. Advanced modeling indicated that while the assumptions for some parametric tests like two-way ANOVA were not fully met, pairwise comparisons using methods such as TukeyHSD consistently found significant differences across age groups.

Population size emerged as a strong predictor of suicide numbers for both sexes. A 1% increase in female population size was associated with a 1.25% increase in female suicides, accounting for 85% of the variation in female suicide rates. Similarly, for males, **a 1% increase in population size corresponded to a 1.18% increase in suicides**, explaining 83% of the variation. Importantly, while population size significantly influenced suicide numbers, the rates of change were similar across sexes, as models found no significant difference in slope between genders.

Conversely, GDP per capita was not a significant predictor of suicide rates for either sex, with models explaining less than 2% of the variation. This finding underscores that economic metrics alone may not sufficiently account for the complexities surrounding suicide rates.

In summary, this research highlights the multifaceted nature of suicide trends, shaped by demographic and societal factors. While **population size is a robust predictor, differences by age and sex are pronounced,** and economic variables like GDP per capita play a minimal role. These findings emphasize the need for targeted, demographic-specific interventions to address suicide prevention effectively.
